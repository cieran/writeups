## You Are Almost There (100 Points)

### Problem
```
What is the password hidden in the twitter ?
(Use the file downloaded from Deep in my mind)
```

### Solution
From the challenge `Almost At The Bottom` we got the twitter user `@GagarineI`.

Looking at their Twitter account, they have only [tweeted](https://twitter.com/GagarineI/status/1408415103133880324) once.

They mentioned a YouTube video, with a picture of a laptop with a sticky note with a password handwritten in Leet Speak.

Manually typing this out gives `P455W0RD_M4N4G3R_15_D3PR3C4D3D`.
